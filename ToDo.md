# ToDo

- Next:
  * polish (`pydocs`, `flake8`, `pylint` etc)
  * cron task
  + remove SPECIAL (db only; fixture?)
  + Speedup csv import
  + i18n, l10n
  + `whichpn.spec`
    * and what about `settings`, `wsgi.conf`?
       rtfm execfile() into `etc/`
       ~~replace by contrib~~
       ~~or setup settings as for prod (but secretkey, db...)~~
